## Socially accountable journaling.

[Just Write](https://kellymason-just-write.herokuapp.com) is a habit-forming writing app for individuals and writing communities. Users can follow others to track their progress via a word counter.

For writers, the idea of writing at least a little bit every day is no novel concept. However, if you've ever tried to keep this habit, _it's hard_. However, when there is a supportive writing commuinity cheering you on, it's almost harder not to.

Just Write allows you to write entries and keep track of your word count. When the entry is finished, writers can choose to keep it privateâ€”or, if it's pure fire, publish it.
