People always ask me, "Kelly, how do you know all these things? It's like you're a walking encyclopedia."\*

I can find information about anything when I have my trusty Blocipedia at my fingertips. Users create and share wikis on any possible topic. It's friendly tooâ€”collaborate with others to ~~embellish~~ enhance your wiki.

\*_Okay, no one has ever said that. Not once._
